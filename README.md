# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
For this project, we are analyzing two outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals and create a visualization which allows us to understand the date more easily. By doing so, we can come up with a conclusion that will help us understand where or when we are successful or areas of improvement. This will allow us to extract necessary information and provide key details on where to make a better decision moving forward that will possibly save time and money since we can focus on which shows to heavily invest in. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As we can see on the chart shown on Theater_Outcome_vs_Launch.png , the month of May has the highest number of theater outcomes compared to other months. Moreover, the Theater show also is the most successful in May with about 67 percent success rate. There seems to be a similar trend between the successful and failed shows throughout the year. For the canceled theater, the numbers are relatively low and do not exceed 10.
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As we can see on the chart shown on Outcomes_vs_Goals.png , the line chart between the percentage successful and failed seem to follow a similar trend, just mirrored. This expresses that both lines relate to one another. The line meets on the goal range between 15000 to 14999, meaning that the success rate and failed rate is equal on 50 percent. While on goal range of 45000 to 49999, the failed rate is 100 percent the success rate is 0%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For deliverable 1, the challenges that I encountered consist of organizing the labels on PivotTable and making sure that the inputs for the columns and rows are correct to display the desired visualization. I overcame it through experimenting with them and eventually came up with the correct labels. Lastly, it was also necessary to filter out the Theater for Parent category and organize the data in a descending order. 
For deliverable 2, the challenge that I encountered is figuring out the different criteria for the first three columns. Figuring out the arguments took me some time to make sure that the dataset is taken from the right columns and that the numbers are filtered correctly for the goal ranges. I overcame it by slowly inputting the criteria with the proper syntax. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion I can draw about the outcomes based on Launch is that the month of May had the higher number of theatrical shows as well as the highest success rate. The possible reason is that people may look for more entertainment in the middle of the year to relieve stress from either school or work throughout the world and found theater as an interesting escape from their life's responsibilities. The second conclusion is that the number of successful theatrical shows are at its lowest in December and slowly come back up in January as we see by the trend of the line chart; The reason is people may prefer to spend more time with their family at home by the end of the year and then proceed to start their year by going out for theatrical entertainment again as the year restarts. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What I can conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals is that the lower the goal range, the higher the likelihood for the show to be successful with over 70 percent success rate for goal less than 4999. It seems simple as lower goal range will be easier to hit than bigger goal range, but we also need to consider the budget for each show or campaign. It is expected for higher budget shows to have a higher goal range as they potentially have higher expectations. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset are possible duplicates and possible inconsistencies or missing values. As we can see, there is about 4000 rows of information on the Kickstarter sheet, so there may be some shows that are duplicates if we do not properly filter or organize the data. The other limitation is possible inconsistencies or missing values and what I mean by that is that with this many data, there is always a possibility of rows to be missing some values or they might not contain proper and accurate information which may hinder the reliability of the results.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For the second deliverable, I experimented with the bar graph and found something that may be more helpful and easier to understand. Since the percentage successful and failed are opposites, as shown on Outcomes_vs_Goals_Bar.png , I used a stacked bar graph so we can easily see the ratio of each percentages as they both stacked out of 100 percent.
